# Bullet Journal
> Digital bullet journal that helps users, such as creatives, with mental health, creative aspirations, and doing their work. In order to help give users a pleasant user experience for journal-like activities.Ã‚ 
## Created by
Noah Alavi, Frances Andrews, Shawn Spicer, and Athene Yowell.

## General Information
- Bullet Journal is a digital bullet journal application that allows users to track mental health over time, utilize journaling and note taking functionality, keep track of their work, and syncing with their calendar of choice.
- As students we where inspired by physical bullet journals and the mindset it fosters. Note taking apps are often minimalist, so we decided to make a customizable app with functionality with other applications for things that would be impossible in a physical journal, such as music.
- We hope that this application will give the user a pleasant and useful user experience with whichever functionality they use, be it listening to music and journaling, tracking their mood and creating graphs with the data, or tracking their assignments and staying on top of their work.
