Research: Google Calendar and API response

Why it's necessary:
The calendar page will need a way to track events. The Google Calendar API enables this functionality. 

Why I am doing it:
I believe it will be easier to implement than a custom solution relying on a local database and custom made functions. 

What I expect to learn/do:
I learned that there are different methods of API calls such as a raw HTTP request and a call using the Python client library, google-api-python-client. 
I learned that there are three options for interacting with Google Calendar as an Add-on, Apps Script (uses JavaScript), and a RESTful API.
Apps Script is a more current implementation.

What I expect to do with it:
I will implement the calendar using the Apps Script. The appearance will need to be enhanced later.

Tasks dependent on research:
