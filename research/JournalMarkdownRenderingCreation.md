## Researching options to create markdown files and display them
### Why it's necessary:
The journal will be utilizing markdown to edit and render it's text files. We will need to figure out how to integrate that functionality through an API in a way that works with HTML/Flask.
### Why I am doing it:
I'm not familiar with the libraries/APIs that exist for this work, and need to figure out how to implement this feature in a sensible way. 
### What I expect to learn/do:
I expect to learn about the options that exist for rendering markdown files, both dynamically and statically. This will be important for the code that creates markdown files, but will be especially important in the later user story where I need to render them (the table of contents/index user story).
### What I expect to do with it:
I'm expecting this to impact the creation of markdown files as well as the rendering of them. This will impact writing the Journal route, as well as a possible sub-route that enables the rendering of files.
### Tasks dependent on research:
